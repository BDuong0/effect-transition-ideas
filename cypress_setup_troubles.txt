Had lots of trouble setting up Cypress with my Vite + React Typescript setup because of a reference error in the 
cypress config file

I fixed the error by changing "cypress.config.ts" -> "cypress.config.js"

- Comment by rezelute: "I can confirm that we have exactly the same issue when setting 
type:module in package.json. Maybe someone could explain why changing cypress.config.ts to 
cypress.config.js makes everything work?"
- Will settle on this solution, even though I'm not sure this is the optimal 'solution' because
  I just spent like at least an hour trying to figure out this issue and I want to spend more time
  actually coding, instead of trying to figure out software.

Chose not to fix the error by removing "type: module" from my package as a medium article by 
Chris Castillo - "Cypress ReferenceError: exports is not defined in ES module scope (w/ Vite)"
suggested b/c I think that the import syntax is non-negotiable for a React application
