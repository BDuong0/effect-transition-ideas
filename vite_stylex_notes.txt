The lastest version of vite-plugin-stylex at the time of writing this (Jan 4, 2025) is 0.13.0 which is
not compatible with the latest version of vite and @stylexjs/stylex. I coudln't install vite-plugin-stylex
version 0.13.0, until I've downgraded the @stylexjs/stylex and vite packages.

From the articles and videos I've seen on the internet on how to setup StyleX with Vite, I saw all of them
us the vite-plugin-stylex and not the PostCSS Plugin. I'm not using babel for my project, so I didn't want to use
the StyleX PostCSS plugin anyway, because I think babel is required to use the StyleX PostCSS plugin.

vite-plugin-stylex version 0.13.0 (latest version as of Jan 4, 2025). Here are the compatible dependency versions.
- npm install --save @stylexjs/stylex@0.9.3
- npm install --save-dev vite@5.2.7


Thank you for this straightforward StyleX + Vite setup tutorial
